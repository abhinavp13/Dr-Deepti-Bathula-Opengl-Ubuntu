We have two files named : 2011CS1001.cpp , makefile.

To build this c++ program, only type (in this directory through terminal) ::   make  

To run this program, type (after building it) ::   ./viewer <IFS.ifs>    

(One can change view to wireframe mode by pressing the 'b' key mention below.)

Some Features ::
---------------

It does all it was supposed to do as an assignment. It also has some extra keys assosiated with it like : 

'B' -> to Change from wireframe mode to normal mode.
'b' -> To change to wireframe mode.
'l' -> To turn off lights.
'L' -> To turn on lights.
